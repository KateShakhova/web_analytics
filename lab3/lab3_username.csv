crypto,How to get into collecting?,295,2019-12-12 10:54:21+00:00,"hey guys, i think this community is really cool, and i don’t want to have a bad experience here. i’ve got a few questions if some people have time to point me in the right direction.

what is the most trustworthy marketplace for purchasing rare consoles/games that are unopened (sealed)?

on ebay i’ve found some pretty cool stuff that was authenticated by “VGA 85” or something. i’ve done a single google search and heard mostly negative things, are they a no-go?

are there websites/forums where people trade/sell these items? i have seen most posts saying “do your own research” and other things along those lines. but i can’t see how such a big community wouldn’t have a hub for safe dealing. 

all feedback is welcomed and appreciated, thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/e9m4q2/how_to_get_into_collecting/

crypto,Just bought a Gotcha Ranger,250,2019-08-20 17:54:05+00:00,"just purchased a Gotcha Ranger, looking to use it in the most efficient way possible.

looking for someone who is using it to its maximum potential, to give me a little guide on how to use it to its max capabilities in terms of efficiency.

if you want to remain anonymous or don’t want to post it publicly, feel free to message me on Reddit. 

if you would like compensation of some sort, i can provide that, not here to waste time.

thanks

i am using it on iOS. not android.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGoSpoofing/comments/ct32z4/just_bought_a_gotcha_ranger/
