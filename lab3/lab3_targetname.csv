wsmith79,This exchange horrible for day trading?  Coin prices are not market,0,2024-06-10 16:16:52+00:00,"I’m getting back into crypto currency after a few years off.  The exchange I used back then, and still prefer, is kucoin but I can’t use it anymore since I’m in USA.  

I like crypto.com exchange and credit card ideas.  I like the exchange at first glance.   But after depositing usd and starting to buy I notice a huge problem:  crypto.com doesn’t trade at market rates but some inflated pricing rate.  

My only assumption is that crypto.com chose to maximize profits by setting trade fees to max, at the expense of day traders. 

Example:

Bitcoin price:

Worldcoinindex price: 69,881
Binance: 69,869
Kraken: 69,884
Crypto.com: 70,475

So if I want to buy bitcoin on crypto.com I have to pay more than market rate?  Huh?

And when I go to sell my bitcoin my sell price is the inverse, I pay 500$ more to buy bitcoin and make $500 less when selling.  

These are hidden fees for the exchange and I absolutely will never use an exchange like this for anything other than cashing out.  

Does crypto.com hate crypto currency traders?

What gives?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptocom/comments/1dcpgig/this_exchange_horrible_for_day_trading_coin/

Competitive-Edge-685,"$SPIKE Price is Surging, How High Can the ""Brett-Killer"" Really Go?
",0,2024-06-10 16:12:28+00:00,"$SPIKE, the original Matt Furie memecoin, has been making waves in the crypto world, with its price surging in recent days. But how high can this ""Brett-killer"" really go?

# The Furie Factor

$SPIKE is the first-ever documented drawing by Matt Furie, the creator of the infamous Pepe the Frog. This unique origin story has captivated the crypto community, especially as the ""Furie meta"" continues to dominate the market. With $PEPE reaching a $7 billion market cap and $BRETT boasting $1.5 billion, the demand for Furie-related memecoins is undeniable.

# Solana's Memecoin Haven

$SPIKE has strategically positioned itself on the Solana blockchain, which has recently emerged as the go-to destination for memecoins. Solana's fast transaction speeds, low fees, and vibrant community provide the perfect environment for $SPIKE to thrive. The recent surge in Solana's decentralized exchange volume, surpassing Ethereum, further solidifies its position as the memecoin capital.

# The Community Takeover

$SPIKE's passionate community is another key factor driving its success. After a rug pull by the initial developer, the community rallied, took control of the project, and revived it from the ashes. This resilience and determination have created a strong bond among $SPIKE holders, who are actively promoting the project and driving its growth.

# Price Predictions

While predicting the future of any cryptocurrency is inherently risky, $SPIKE's unique value proposition and strong community support suggest significant upside potential. Some analysts believe that $SPIKE could potentially overtake $BRETT in market cap, given its originality and the growing demand for Furie-related memecoins.

Others are even more bullish, suggesting that $SPIKE could eventually challenge $PEPE's dominance. While this may seem ambitious, the combination of factors working in $SPIKE's favor – including its originality, Solana's momentum, and its passionate community – cannot be ignored.

# Conclusion

$SPIKE is a memecoin with a compelling story, a strong community, and a unique position in the Furie meta. While the future is uncertain, the current trajectory suggests that $SPIKE has the potential to reach new heights and possibly even challenge the established players in the memecoin market.

Mods haven't been sure on how to deal with the image posts given Rizzo's [ relation to Kraken:](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1c8p246/ama_with_the_bitcoin_historian/) *""I'm Rizzo, the Bitcoin historian, author of over 2,000 articles on cryptocurrency and Editor At Large at Kraken.""* and that fact that the sub seems to enjoy these posts ([7 out of 10 top posts in the last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/top/?t=month) are Rizzos Bitcoin Historian posts).

Given that the sub didn't have distributions the image posts by Rizzo didn't really matter outside of mods allowing for an exception to the rules. With distributions looking to come back soon this will likely become a point of contention among users if Rizzo is able to earn a huge amount of karma/Moons from image posts and other users are not.

**This raises the question of how should we handle image posts going forward?**

# Solution:

I am proposing that we make the ability to post image posts a condition of special membership.

Given the following conditions:

* The Image Post is not a Meme or other ""Low Quality"" Image Post (as determined by mods).
* The Image Post has complete context from the title and the image.
   * If the post requires additional context outside of the image and title - post it as a text post and add the image to the text post.

**Why not just uphold the existing rules and stop allowing image posts?**

I think the biggest argument for allowing Image posts is that there is incredibly high demand for these image posts, as seen by the amount of attention they get on r/CryptoCurrency. As such leaning into that demand and making them accessible via Special Membership will increase the utility and demand for special memberships especially once distributions return.

Gatekeeping them behind special memberships and not making them available for all will also limit the total amount of image posts that get shared on the sub.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/1dcp9vp/proposal_make_image_posts_a_benefit_of_special/

# The Furie Factor

$SPIKE is the first-ever documented drawing by Matt Furie, the creator of the infamous Pepe the Frog. This unique origin story has captivated the crypto community, especially as the ""Furie meta"" continues to dominate the market. With $PEPE reaching a $7 billion market cap and $BRETT boasting $1.5 billion, the demand for Furie-related memecoins is undeniable.

# Solana's Memecoin Haven

$SPIKE has strategically positioned itself on the Solana blockchain, which has recently emerged as the go-to destination for memecoins. Solana's fast transaction speeds, low fees, and vibrant community provide the perfect environment for $SPIKE to thrive. The recent surge in Solana's decentralized exchange volume, surpassing Ethereum, further solidifies its position as the memecoin capital.

# The Community Takeover

$SPIKE's passionate community is another key factor driving its success. After a rug pull by the initial developer, the community rallied, took control of the project, and revived it from the ashes. This resilience and determination have created a strong bond among $SPIKE holders, who are actively promoting the project and driving its growth.

# Price Predictions

While predicting the future of any cryptocurrency is inherently risky, $SPIKE's unique value proposition and strong community support suggest significant upside potential. Some analysts believe that $SPIKE could potentially overtake $BRETT in market cap, given its originality and the growing demand for Furie-related memecoins.

Others are even more bullish, suggesting that $SPIKE could eventually challenge $PEPE's dominance. While this may seem ambitious, the combination of factors working in $SPIKE's favor – including its originality, Solana's momentum, and its passionate community – cannot be ignored.

# Conclusion

$SPIKE is a memecoin with a compelling story, a strong community, and a unique position in the Furie meta. While the future is uncertain, the current trajectory suggests that $SPIKE has the potential to reach new heights and possibly even challenge the established players in the memecoin market.

MaestroBots,5 Common Challenges of De-Fi Trading (PART 1) ,0,2024-06-10 16:09:04+00:00,"If you’re thinking about trading or you’re a new trader, here are some common risks to be aware of. Keep reading and learn how you can minimize your risk.

# 1. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:

Smart contracts are the backbone of DeFi, but they can be susceptible to bugs and vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability is found, hackers can drain funds from the protocol. 

Check for security certificates and audit reports from reputable firms to help lower your risk.

# 2. Rug Pulls:

Developers can create tokens and liquidity pools, then withdraw all the liquidity, leaving traders with worthless tokens. This is a very common scam.

Conduct extensive research on the development team and the project’s history. Look for transparent projects with locked liquidity or audited smart contracts. Avoid investing large sums in new or unverified projects.

[**Maestro’s Anti-Rug**](https://docs.maestrobots.com/wallet-settings/general-settings#anti-rug) can also help mitigate risk by detecting malicious transactions in the mempool and attempting to sell holdings before the transaction is executed. Anti-rug also offers comprehensive protection to guard against liquidity rugs, trade disables, tax hikes and unnatural mints. This feature will also automatically adjust gas price and delta to maximize frontrunning chances.

# 3. Impermanent Loss:

Providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol can lead to impermanent loss, where the value of deposited assets changes unfavourably. This can result in lower returns than simply holding the assets.

Diversify liquidity provision across different pools and protocols to help mitigate this.

# 4. Market Volatility:

The crypto market is extremely volatile, with prices fluctuating rapidly. Traders must be prepared for significant gains or losses in a short period.

Use stoploss orders and set price alerts to manage your positions. Diversify your portfolio to spread risk across different assets. Avoid over-leveraging and always be prepared for the worst case scenario.

Select your stoploss percentage, price or market cap in [**Maestro’s Sniper Bot**](https://www.maestrobots.com/#sniper) settings or use the [trailing stop-loss](https://docs.maestrobots.com/trade-monitor/trailing-stoploss) feature to slowly increase the stoploss as the token’s P/L increases.

Use [**Maestro’s Wallet Bot**](https://www.maestrobots.com/#wallet) to keep track of your crypto balances with blazing fast price alerts all within the same platform.

# 5. Regulatory Risks:

DeFi operates largely in an unregulated space. Future regulations could impact the legality and functionality of DeFi platforms, creating uncertainty. Stay informed about regulatory developments in your region.  

While DeFi trading offers many opportunities, it also comes with a range of risks that traders must carefully manage. Maestro Bots makes trading easier and helps you reduce your risk.

# The Furie Factor

$SPIKE is the first-ever documented drawing by Matt Furie, the creator of the infamous Pepe the Frog. This unique origin story has captivated the crypto community, especially as the ""Furie meta"" continues to dominate the market. With $PEPE reaching a $7 billion market cap and $BRETT boasting $1.5 billion, the demand for Furie-related memecoins is undeniable.

# Solana's Memecoin Haven

$SPIKE has strategically positioned itself on the Solana blockchain, which has recently emerged as the go-to destination for memecoins. Solana's fast transaction speeds, low fees, and vibrant community provide the perfect environment for $SPIKE to thrive. The recent surge in Solana's decentralized exchange volume, surpassing Ethereum, further solidifies its position as the memecoin capital.

# The Community Takeover

$SPIKE's passionate community is another key factor driving its success. After a rug pull by the initial developer, the community rallied, took control of the project, and revived it from the ashes. This resilience and determination have created a strong bond among $SPIKE holders, who are actively promoting the project and driving its growth.

# Price Predictions

While predicting the future of any cryptocurrency is inherently risky, $SPIKE's unique value proposition and strong community support suggest significant upside potential. Some analysts believe that $SPIKE could potentially overtake $BRETT in market cap, given its originality and the growing demand for Furie-related memecoins.

Others are even more bullish, suggesting that $SPIKE could eventually challenge $PEPE's dominance. While this may seem ambitious, the combination of factors working in $SPIKE's favor – including its originality, Solana's momentum, and its passionate community – cannot be ignored.

# Conclusion

$SPIKE is a memecoin with a compelling story, a strong community, and a unique position in the Furie meta. While the future is uncertain, the current trajectory suggests that $SPIKE has the potential to reach new heights and possibly even challenge the established players in the memecoin market.

Living_Experience_31,POWSCHE vs Other Memecoins: Why POWSCHE stands out,5,2024-06-10 16:05:23+00:00,"I’ve been in the crypto space for a little while now and have been exploring memecoins.  

Currently, it’s a minefield of coin after coin. There are so many cats and dogs, with or without hats popping up every single day.

I’ve had a very positive experience with POWSCHE, it’s just under 3 months old, so it’s stood the test of time in this fast-paced memecoin world we live in.  The holders have so much conviction that they didn’t sell when some of them had near to $3.5 Million in their wallets. I can understand why they have so much conviction, which I am going to go into so you can have the full picture. 

**So what makes POWSCHE Different?** (In no particular order)

**POWSCHE podcast** - The podcast is informative and it gives you a sense of what POWSCH and the community want to achieve, it’s available on Spotify and YouTube.

**Twitter Spaces** - Launched recently, the plan is for the Dev (Mr Powsche) to go live on Twitter Spaces, he’s there to chat about up-and-coming plans and field any questions from the community, he always available in the Telegram group, sometimes around the clock!

**Porsche lottery giveaway** - By just buying POWSCHE and holding you are in with a chance to win an actual Porsche, which is a fantastic way to give back to the holders. 

**POWSCHE referral programme** - POWSCHE has developed a referral programme to earn POWSCHE from everyone you refer with your referrer link.  This way of thinking is innovative and exactly what this memecoin space needs. 

**Leadership team** - the POWSCHE team has set up specific areas and teams that concentrate on marketing, strategy, sales etc, this is unheard off in this space, they are running POWSCHE like a business.

**Experts** - POWSCHE has industry-leading experts on the team, whether it’s in cryptocurrency, investing, or marketing, the team is top tier, which really makes you confident that the right team is in place and will guarantee the success of this coin.

**Tesla and Lambo burns** - These are planned at various milestones and they are going to be streamed live on Kick for the world to see, I would imagine this is going to generate millions of views bringing a lot of new investors into the space. 

**Tesla giveaway to a single mother** - This is a fantastic way to give back to the community in-real life. 

**Community Engagement** - I’ve not seen a community like this, well maybe the early GME days when there was a positive outlook and vibe, this is exactly what you’re getting here, join the Telegram and see for yourself.  

**Strong Roadmap** -  With clear goals and innovative plans, POWSCHE is always thinking ahead, it’s good to see an actual roadmap for once, there are too many coins not willing to put the effort into this. 

**Luxury Branding** - Just like Porsche, owning POWSCHE is a statement of style and class, it’s an aspirational brand, highly recognisable, and makes you proud to be part of the POWSCHE movement.

**So how does POWSCHE compare to other Memecoins?**

Well, after reading all of the above, how do you think it compares to other memecoins?

For me it’s clear, POWSCHE stands out more than any other memecoin out there, it’s category-defining, first to the market and the team is full of experts with a clear vision and strategy.  It’s not a pump and dump, I can guarantee that, 

DYOR - Don’t just take my word for it, join the community, check the vibe and only when you’re comfortable, then invest a couple (or more) Solana.  Then you just need to hold, sit back and relax as you know Mr Powsche is here to stay and won’t have magically disappeared overnight like a lot of these coins. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1dcp6hn/powsche_vs_other_memecoins_why_powsche_stands_out/

Scruffy Britannia $2320 Shipped

.99999 Canada gold $2325 Shipped

2- 1987 pandas $2330 Each shipped

Prices good as long as spot on [kitco](https://www.kitco.com/price/precious-metals) is under $2,320 an oz.

Payments:

Free: Google pay, Zelle (Preferred), and Venmo. If planning to use venmo please send me your username, so I can send you a request. **ABSOLUTELY NO NOTES!!!** Any notes for any of the payment methods (other than Venmo where you'll use a single random letter), may result in a cancellation of the entire transaction. If you send payment as goods and services, I'll will refund the payment minus the fee, and cancel the transaction.

Buyer pays fees: Crypto (USDC no fee). For crypto sales, once we establish a crypto amount that amount is valid for 5 minutes.

I’m open to other methods, but no PayPal, just pm me and we can discuss.

Shipping:

**UPS is available for a little extra.**

If the prices above includes shipping, that is for US addresses and will be sent ground advantage unless stated otherwise or weight restricted. If you're international I'll calculate your shipping rate, and subtract the included rate.

All prices below are for the us only, if you want international shipping just message me and I'll get you a price. Weight is based on shipment weight not item(s) weight(s).

0-12 oz package $5

12-14 oz package = $6.75

Over 14 oz package = $9.25 and up Priority/UPS

1-2 day shipping = $26.5

Insurance can be added but only registered mail covers bullion, so it will be slowish and expensive for low value packages. A $1,000 package would cost $23, and a $5,000 package would be $31.95 anything over that is $2.35 per extra $1,000

Once the package is dropped off with the delivery service, all responsibility of the package is with the delivery service and the buyer.

With that said I package safe, and if any problems arise I’ll will do my best to help resolve them.

As always prices are reasonably negotiable, if you need more pictures let me know. Offers of full price take precedent over discounted offers and offers for multiple items take precedent over single items. If multiple offers are made on an item and a deal is struck you have one hour to pay or it goes on to the next buyer. Unreasonable offers will be ignored.

Roscoflux,Telegram Bot taxes,1,2024-06-10 15:44:39+00:00,"Hey Reddit Fam,

I am currently battling the IRS for some crypto trades from 2021.

That being said, I have been trading meme coins this year (2024) on the Telegram Trojan Bot. I have been doing my best to manually keep track of the trades, but I was just curious if any one knows the best way to track these wallets.

I have signed up for Koinly and Cointracker (both just have the free plans so far) but they are not updating the data live.

Questions I have.

For apps like Koinly do I need to also track the memecoin address or is only the Solana address sufficient?

Can anybody point me in the right direction to the best practices for tracking my telegram Solana wallet.

Hoping telegram will release a feature for the bot that will allow us to export some sort of file or csv detailing all the trades.

Thanks fam hope you are doing welll!",https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1dconzq/telegram_bot_taxes/

I was introduced to it by a guy I met online who convinced me to transfer around 15k USD into the platform as USDT. I have cleared out my bank account to do this. 

And after I refused to put anymore money into it he offered to pay half (also 15k) because he said we need 30k to ensure 0 loss trades. Which he sent me instructions on how to trade. And it worked. 

I have a 27k profit in the platform now. 

But the platform is saying I need to pay 20% tax before I can withdraw the funds. Because the profit is over 20k usd. And they refuse to just accept money from the trading account saying I need to send them 5440USDT to their customer support wallet before I can withdraw the funds. 

The website has a Colorado certificate of good standing but does anyone have experience with the platform that can say it’s not a scam?

Foreverhooping89,Balancing Cash Flow vs Investing,0,2024-06-10 15:43:34+00:00,"Hey Bogleheads, as the question asks, **How do you all consider cash flow vs saving for retirement?**

I'm in SoCal and my wife and I gross 150K... we work in the education field (I'm a 5th-year teacher, and my wife is a school nurse). I'm turning 35 next week, she will be 40 next month. No living kids, no debt of any kind, we drive older cars (18 and 19 years old). 7-8 month Emergency Fund. 

Our net pay is 8K/month; I currently bring home $4,650 and will receive an 8K raise (from $87,700 to $95,500) starting July 1. My question stems from trying to catch up on retirement savings as I'm behind (increasing savings rate to 20% not including my pension) and wanting to save up cash for our savings goals. I’d like to retire at 62 if our future home is paid off.

**My Current expenses:**

Rent + utilities: $2,000 

Down payment savings: $1,500 (Have just over 120K; goal is 150K by EOY 2025)

Living expenses (gas for car, life/car insurance, cell phone)  $400 

Retirement savings (maxed out Roth IRA, Brokerage, Crypto ETF) $701

Fun Money: $50

**Retirement Savings as of 06/01/2024:**

Roth IRA: $27,371 ($581/month)

403B: $24,535 ($700/month; increasing this to 1K/month in July)

Brokerage: $1,214 ($100/month)

Crypto: $56 ($20/month)

Pension Contributions (10% of salary): $38,000

We have other savings goals (IVF/Baby fund, newer car funds, honeymoon, vacation, and a few sports events between this fall and 2026). 

Very conservatively estimating i will get 3K/month from my pension (intentionally lowballing this number), realistically I'll get closer to 4-5K/month. My wife will also get a pension and SS.

Cash flow vs retirement savings is definitely a balancing act; I’m trying to act like the raise i am getting doesn't exist, which is why I'm throwing more into the 403B. Lifestyle creep is a genuine concern of mine. On the other hand, it would be nice to throw more towards our savings goals and go out more than 1-2x/month. 

How do you all balance cash flow vs retirement savings? 

How about when getting raises? Invest it and act like it didn't exist? Save half/some and spend the rest?

 Any help is appreciated.

So who are the people that have created this MC?

7X MC takes over Ðoge
30X MC takes over Sol
100X MC takes over ETH

I’m rounding up or down for these numbers.

**Negative Tax (NETA):** 

NETA isn't just your average token; it's a groundbreaking innovation in the world of Base Chain. What sets NETA apart is its negative tax mechanism, designed to incentivize investors not only to buy but also to hold onto their tokens. Imagine getting rewarded for holding onto your investments – that's the magic of NETA!

**Negative Tax (NETA): �**�

NETA isn't just your average token; it's a groundbreaking innovation in the world of Base Chain. What sets NETA apart is its negative tax mechanism, designed to incentivize investors not only to buy but also to hold onto their tokens. Imagine getting rewarded for holding onto your investments – that's the magic of NETA!

**NETASWAP: �**�

Now, let's talk about NETASWAP – the cross-chain aggregator swap that simplifies token bridging and swapping on Base Chain. With NETASWAP, you can experience seamless cross-chain transactions, optimal trading rates, and top-notch security and trust. This platform isn't just about transactions; it's about creating a user-centric space that prioritizes your trading experience.

**How the contract works: �**�

When you buy NETA tokens, you'll encounter a 5% buy tax. But here's the twist – 10.5% of your total buy gets refunded back to you in tokens! Selling? You'll face a 5% tax. The beauty of this system is that the roundtrip tax can actually result in a 0.225% profit if the price remains stable. Yes, you read that right – a negative tax token that rewards you for your transactions!

**Tax Breakdown: �**�

3% of the buy and sell tax is allocated for ETH rewards, automatically distributed to holders every hour. Another 2% goes towards expenses, ensuring the platform runs smoothly and efficiently.

ceraq,Schnäppchenhaus in Berlin kaufen oder weiter HODL?,17,2024-06-10 15:20:55+00:00,"Hallo zusammen,

  
ich habe die Möglichkeit ein Reihenhaus in Berlin Neuköln zu kaufen mit 5 Zimmern, 125qm Wohnraum und einen Garten. Das Haus ist aus den 80ern und sieht dementsprechend auch so aus.

Das Haus könnte ich kaufen für 390.000€. Der Verkehrswert laut Bank beträgt 445.000€. Aktuell habe ich knapp 50k in Crypto und 12k im FTSE ALL World. Ich erwarte durch die Zinssenkung der EZB und der FED und der Wahl in den USA noch stärkere Anstiege in meinem Portfolio. Mein Nettoeinkommen im Monat ist 3600€. Meine Freundin macht ihre Ausbildung noch fertig. Danach kommen hoffentlich nochmal 1800€ von ihr hinzu was die Familienplanung einfacher macht.

  
However, wenn ich das alles verkaufen würde, könnte ich mir das Haus mit einer Rate von c.a. 1600€ leisten. So viel kosten hier 4 Zimmer Wohnungen.

Meine Eltern reden stark auf mich ein und empfehlen mir das Haus zu kaufen und zu vermieten. Schließlich gibt es viele Familien, welche eine günstig vermietete 5 Zimmer Wohnung/Haus hätten. Jedoch entsteht für mich ein Aufwand den ich aktuell nicht einschätzen kann. Noch bin ich 24 und wohne bei meinen Eltern. 



**TLDR**; Was würdet ihr an meiner Stelle machen Haus für einen tollen Preis kaufen oder lieber weiter Vermögenswerte halten?

WannaFIREinBE,2 years of using PLUTUS and and exiting,3,2024-06-10 15:20:21+00:00,"Two years ago, like a few of us who tried something else than the crypto.com credit cards after the rewards were slashed during the crypto winter, I tried to use Plutus and kept on using it for two years before stopping using it last month because the project is on a crash course in my opinion.

Here is my experience:

I have used Plutus for a bit more than 2 years.

My Fiat account is empty, all my PLU have been withdrawn and sold, and I have downgraded my subscription to the free one. Planning on asking for my account deletion.

Here is my experience over the two years:

- I never staked any PLU nor have I ever obtained any amount elligible for any stake level. I was burned by cdc before so I vowed to never purchase my way to a stake. The minimum stake for Plutus was already quite high so it made it an easy decision not to go for it.

- I started by enjoying the free account, then the two perk paying account @4,99€/month, then @9,99€/month, then when planning my exit of the platform the 6,99€/month for a couple of months in order to be able to withdraw the last of my PLU. Total amount disbursed in subscription = 103,83€.

- I used the DEX to sell immediately my PLU to top up my card. I was able to sell +-90€ of PLU this way.

- after the DEX temporary suspension (which is still ongoing and a major reason of my departure), I had to initiate 5 different withdrawals. 3 x 3€, 1 x 7.5€, 1 x 15€ = 31.5€

- I spend ETH to send my PLU to my Coinbase account on those 5 occasions. For a total of 11.47€ at time of using the gas fee. (Setting up manually the fee at below the minimum and still getting to next block)

- when I initiated the transfer of my PLU they were worth 700€, when Coinbase said I sold them for BTC it was 682€ but I only got 663€ of BTC. So if I had sold it direct to € on each occasion I would have got 663€ from 700€ I withdrawn just from the decay of the value of PLU and the cost of converting it to a valuable currency.

The good thing is, I held to the BTC and it is now worth something like 1200€ which minus all cost is around 1050€ of benefit by using the platform for 2 years. So +-43€ a month stressing about the imminent rugpull of the platform has been fun but the current situation make it not worth it.

It is still a pretty good result but most of the gains are due to being relatively early and converting to BTC wich has appreciated a bunch contrarily to PLU. What I can gain from it now isn’t worth the hassle and the stress.

So that’s it. For those who have joined Plutus:
- are you still using it?
- if not, where you able to profit from it?

I hope nobody got burned :-)",https://www.reddit.com/r/BEFire/comments/1dco34d/2_years_of_using_plutus_and_and_exiting/

We don't have PayPal zelle venmo(as a country) and internationaI transfers are expensive, don't think they will be suitable, sorry. I currently have no cash left in my account until paycheck, and I have some little expenses on the way, don't want to use my credit card, because of interest, happy if someone can help me out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/borrowdeletes/comments/1dcn7jt/uveganjunk1e_req_was_deleted_from_rborrow_on/
YesterdayDreamer,Implementing a secure data storage solution,0,2024-06-10 14:43:04+00:00,"Hi friends. This is more of a personal project, which, if it every reaches a certain level of maturity, I'll try to release as an open source project. But at the moment, just for learning purposes.

So I want to store some sensitive user info in as secure a way as possible on a server. My first idea was to implement encryption on the client side. However, after a long struggle with SubtleCrypto, I finally gave up on it. I realized my knowledge of Javascript is not good enough to use this library as of now. So I went back to my comfort zone, which is Python. I'm creating the server using FastAPI and will be building a front-end using VueJs.

So this is how the process works as of now:

1. When the user registers, the following happens on the server:
   1. Create a randomly generated encryption key for the user
   2. Derive a key using the user's password (Scrypt)
   3. Encrypt the encryption key using the derived key and store in the user model
   4. The derived key is not stored anywhere

2. When the user logs in
   1. I derive the key using the user's password. Obviously this gives me the same result as before
   2. I use this to decrypt the user's encryption key
   3. I add this key to the jwt token and send in the response

3. When the user saves some data:
   1. I read the jwt token from the request and extract the encryption key
   2. Encrypt the user data using the encryption key and store the encrypted data

4. When the user fetches data:
   1. I read the jwt token from the request and extract the encryption key
   2. Decrypt the user data using the encryption key and return the decrypted data

So here's how I have tried to ensure security:

* The server never has the encryption key unless it needs to encrypt or decrypt the data
* At rest, the encryption key itself is encrypted with the user's password on the server. Since the password is only know to the user, hence the data cannot be decrypted by the server in any way
* When the user logs in, the encryption key is encoded in the jwt token, which means the front-end has, but can't read the encryption key
* When saving or retrieving the data, the encryption key is decoded from the token and used, but is never written to disk, only available in memory

I'm aware of the pitfall that if the user forgets their password, there will be no way to recover the data. As of now, I'm only dealing with text data and not files or any sort of binary data.

Is there anything I'm missing, any step which can make the data vulnerable? I'm talking about obvious flaws in the process and not a targeted attack.

corycba,TIFU By Falling for Fake Crypto Platform (Lost 62k in a Flash!)**,58,2024-06-10 14:37:52+00:00,"Today I Finally Admit I F'd Up

Feeling like the world's biggest financial doofus right now. A year ago I invested our entire savings, $62,000, into a crypto trading app that looked legit – charts, graphs, the whole nine yards. Turns out, it was all a lie.

By the time I realized it was a fake app, the money was already gone.  They designed it to delay any chance of canceling the transaction. Now I'm lucky to have a wife who's here to stay and stuck recovering a bank account that looks like a college student's fridge after finals week.

Anyone else get scammed by a fake crypto app?  Is there a chance of getting the money back, or am I destined to a life of ramen noodles and self-loathing?
Any other words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.  Feeling lost and hoping the internet has some magic advice (because ramen for two isn't exactly my idea of a romantic dinner).

Edit: I never traded cryptocurrency, I lost the money as soon as I swapped it from Robinhood to the Achain trading app. No trading took place.

TL;DR 
I lost 62k to a scam trading app and bet the house on it, a year later and I'm still trying to save up and fix my mistake.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1dcn2ht/tifu_by_falling_for_fake_crypto_platform_lost_62k/
EarlyComparison8567,My bf is hiding something from me,12,2024-06-10 14:37:27+00:00,"I was on call with my boyfriend, and then I asked if I could borrow his telegram account since I couldn't log in to mine for some reason (na log out telegram ko kasi I upgraded my phone and nag bubug telegram ko so I couldn't log in). My purpose was to check a link that would lead me to a group, but things got heated. He declined my request and insisted it's his privacy daw, so I jokingly said ""ano tinatago mo"" and laughed. He got offended because I was accusing him of cheating daw, when I didn't mention anything about a girl. 

I was caught off guard with his reaction (to make some things clear, I am paranoid because I've been cheated numerous times by my past relationships, and yes, I do accuse him sometimes, but he assures me). 

I argued back at him about why he was so defensive; he kept on insisting that he didn't want his personal space invaded and that he wanted privacy. He also added that I don't need to have access to his social media (I don't have access to any), and it is toxic if sobrang higpit. So I got offended. I told him that we engage in sex as a sign of devotion to each other and to indicate our trust, so it shouldn't be a big deal if I invade a little of his privacy since we are one and I don’t mind whatever he has on his tg.

We argued back and forth, and I was still emphasizing that it is okay to expose our bodies and private parts, but not social media. He said it was for personal space and privacy; I don't have to be paranoid because he showed loyalty and faithfulness to me, which is true. But I couldn't help but question: what would he lose if he gave me his telegram since it was all about crypto and bet lang andoon? He said he felt uneasy and would show me in person. To make a long story short, I gave in and believed him, but I am still bothered by the thought of it. Im too scared to be called toxic for asking one his social for some purposes. It's unfair, but I don't know what to do. Please help

meamyboffee,"Binance, crypto currency عملات رقمية ونيابة العامة وتصكر حسابي البنك يعني من الآخر الموضوع فل سبايسي يقماعه وابي أشاركه معاكم وهم ابي احد يفيدني ",11,2024-06-10 14:36:52+00:00,"قوه سلام عالكل اخواني وخواتي وأعزائي والجميع، أما بعد…

في موضوع صار وياي وابي اشاركه معاكم وبنفس الوقت آخذ رأيكم. بس قبل كل شي، راح يكون عندي مليون بدليات واعذرني على ذالك. 

الموضوع يخص العملات الرقمية، Crypto Currency 

سافرت وتخرجت ورديت الكويت والحمدالله حصلت لي وظيفة من أربع شهور مهنتي خبير الأمن السيبراني وراتبي ٧٠٠. لمن توظفت رحت فجيت لي حساب راتب اب بنك التمويل. وغير التمويل كان عندي كذا بنك ومنهم بنك وياي Weyay. 

الزبده، بشهر ٥ يعني الشهر الي طاف نزلت تطبيق Binance وسويت في ايداع. طبعاً أنا كان راتبي على التمويل وضفت مستفيد عندي بالتمويل وحولت للمستفيد واهو بعدين دزلي USDT على حسابي الBinance. طبعاً بشهر ٥ مرتين شريت الدولار بقيمة ٣٠٠ و٣٠٠ دينار حولت لهم من حسابي التمويل ومرتين بعت بقيمة ٣٠٠و٣٠٠ دينار وحوولي الشخص على حسابي وياي. والبيع شلون كان؟ كان ان في مصري من Binance يشتري مني دولار وأنا ادز له لينك من حسابي وياي وبعدين اهو يحوولي وعقبها أنا اطلع الفلوس من حسابي وياي واحوله احطهم بحسابي التمويل.  عالعموم، يوم ٤ شهر ٦ الي اهو الشهر هذا، صار مادري تقريبا ٨ عمليت بمبلغ ١٧٠٠ دينار على حسابي وياي و٨ عمليات ١٧٠٠ دينار بالتمويل باليوم الواحد. شلون؟ المصري شرا مني دولار الUSDT وأنا عطيت له لينك من حسابي وياي وبعدين أنا رجعت حولت الفلوس إلى حسابي التمويل عن طريق اللينك وعقبها ضفت مستفيدين بحسابي التمويل وفعلتهم وبعدها حولت للمستفيدين الدينار واهم بعدين دزولي الدولار لحسابي الBinance. طبعاً ابي انبه شغله، جميع المبالغ الي استلمته من المصري عن طريق اللينكات كانت من حسابات يعني حسابات ناس مختلفة. عالعموم. نفس اليوم الي اهو ٤، ألقى حسابي الوياي والتمويل عليهم حظر وهمن بطاقاتي من هالبنكين انحذفو من الapply pay. دقيت على البنكين، التمويل قالي راجع الفرع ووياي قالولي راح يتواصلون معاي بس ماتواصلو. 

كلمت خوالي بالموضوع، جان واحد منهم يكلم صاحبه محقق بالنيابة، المحقق قال ان الموضوع غالباً اشتباه، وهمن خوالي كلمو مباحث بالنيابة العامة للأموال قال الموضوع اشتباه، والوالدة كلمت ارفيجتها اهيه ريلها محقق بالنيابة العامة للتجارة قال ان ممكن اشتباه غسيل أموال وتمويل ارهاب طبعاً أنا عادي مهما قالو اهما شنو مايكون السبب ماتهمني لان فلوسي نظيف وعندي كل الفواتير بس يعني الحبيب الأخير يوم قال جذي وأنا أشوف اصلي افغاني وجوازي افغاني الموضوع خرعني اشكره بيدبسوني بتمويل ارهاب والحين اقعد حبيبي الحين اقعد، اقعد سنة سنتين ثلاثه من وزارة لوزارة من خرا ل خرا اقعد اسنين بهالمشكلة عقب ماانشق عقبها الموضوع ينحل ويتصكر. 

رحت البنك أسبوع الي طاف، كلمتهم قلت لهم حسابي متصكر ومادري شنو السبب، الموظف صيدا ما ادري ليش يوظفون ناس بمهن مايفهمون فيه؟ لعنابو الي اخترع شي اسمه واسطات، المهم، قاعد الغبي مو فاهم شقاعد يسوي قاعد نص ساعه مادري شيخربط وآخر شي يأخذ ورقه ويكتبلي فيها رقم ويقولي راجع النيابة وقبل مايكتب الورقه قالي انت شنو تشتغل وليش ٨ معاملة بحسابك ابيوم واحد ورديت عليه حسسته أني تاجر معتمد عود بالسوق ههه ولااا واقوله اخوي أنا تاجر معتمد أنا بالعملات الرقمية بمنصة Binance!! وااااايااااهووووووووو اول ماسمعت النيابة بالموضوع حسيت إني I’m gonna shit on myself. 

وطبعاً للحين ماراجعت النيابة.  

والحين ابي اسأل، هل احد صاير معا موضوع مثل جذي؟ وابي اعرف شلون حسابي الوياي والتمويل تصكرو بنفس الوقت بالضبط؟؟؟ هالامر من وين؟؟ اكيد في هيئة مركزية طلبت من البنكين أنهم يقفلون حسابي! ولا النيابة سوت جذي؟ بس مو ان النيابة العامة ولا مادري نيابة المالية مو هذا المحكمة؟ مادري قع انجلط ماني فاهم شلون البنكين تصكرو بنفس اللحظة وللحين وليش قالولي راجع النيابة؟ وأوكي مثلاً خنقول فيه اشتباه، هل اشتباه وصل عند منو؟ ومنو اشتبه؟ شلون يصير جذي؟ ابي اهم؟؟؟ لان الموضوع وأيد مضايقني الحين عندي فلوس بالمنصة ١٣٥ ألف دينار طبعاً هالمبلغ بالذات ماله أي صله بالكويت لان هل مبلغ أنا ربحتهم وسويت ايداع وسحب كل شي خارج الكويت الديره الي كنت ادرس فيه وعقب ماخلصت دراستي وكنت راد الكويت شريت USDT بمبلغ ١٣٥ ألف دينار وحطيتهم بحسابي الBinance والحين ابي اسحب منهم شوي لان مابي أغامر وآخذ ريسك كبير على كل فلوسي ابي نصهم أغامر فيهم وابي مثلا اسحب ٤٠ ألف دينار واحطهم عندي وديعه بالبنك اتييلي أرباح آمن شهريه بس مو عارف شلون لان سواء بعت دولار بقيمة ٤٠ ألف دينار على واحد بال P2P وحوولي حوالة من بنكه لبنكي همن احتمال مره ثانيه النيابة ولا شرايكم؟ وإذا مثلا اسحبهم شوي شوي يعني كل أسبوع ١٠ ألف دينار بالشهر ٤٠ ألف دينار يعني تقريبا نفس الموضوع وممكن مره ثانيه اشتباه يصير؟ 

وابي ألاحظ شغله، ان البنكين عندي تقريبا مافيهم مبالغ جايده يعني اجمالي ممكن ٣٠٠٠ دينار وراتبي بعد ينزل عليه أهني المشكلة!! ف الي مر عليه مشكلة مثل جذي وراح النيابة، قولي شنو صار وياكم وشنو حققو وياك؟ وفتحو لك الحساب ولا وجم خذه وقت على ما يفتح؟ أنا اهلي قالولي انطر خنرتب مع محقق، ومادري مباحث وشنو وعقبها روح مع عمك ولا خالك وشوف شنو الموضوع بس ياخي مافيني صبر إلا ابي اروح بأسرع وقت سواء مع احد ولا بروحي واشوف شنو الموضوع بس اخاف اروح بروحي واخورها يررربع يعني صج صج اخورها بعض الضباط ينرفزون حيل ودي اخنقه.

First off, I would not be ""Investing"" in this knife...it would be a collection piece in my otherwise humble knife collection.  It would not be up for resale or anything like that.  I am looking for an heirloom type knife to hold on to and hand down to my kids someday!  So the big question is, would it be better to buy the knife and deplete my Bitcoin or keep the crypto and hope it makes me more money someday?  Crypto is so volatile right now, it wouldn't hurt my feelings to get out while I can...but is a knife a good way to spend it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/knives/comments/1dcmttt/do_custom_knives_hold_or_increase_in_value/
Jhonjournalist,Crypto NFT issuers in South Korea are subject to new laws ,0,2024-06-10 14:25:45+00:00,"https://preview.redd.it/ma3frzbv7r5d1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d6e02c290c9821bbbf8a748dd97365a3a5416ba

* New South Korean law requires [NFT](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/by-2029-nft-marketing-service-market-will-reach-all-over-the-world/) issuers to register as virtual asset operators.
* Focus on NFTs with investment-like characteristics aims to protect consumers.
* Crypto projects in South Korea face pressure to adapt to evolving regulations.

The new Korean Virtual Asset User Protection Act mandates NFT issuers to register as virtual asset operators, marking a pivotal move in regulating the burgeoning crypto sector.

In South Korea, where [cryptocurrency](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/for-his-presidential-campaign-donald-trump-will-accept-cryptocurrency-donations/) adoption is high and concerns about pension fund returns prevail, regulatory actions reflect a delicate balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers.

# South Korea’s NFT Regulations: Protecting Investors

South Korea’s [crypto](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/the-crypto-market-lost-80-billion-in-hours-after-bitcoin-btc-dropped-below-69k/) landscape sees a new horizon with the Korean Virtual Asset User Protection Act, mandating NFT issuers to register as virtual asset operators. This regulatory milestone aims to fortify oversight and consumer protection in the dynamic digital asset ecosystem.

The regulatory focus on NFTs exhibiting investment-like traits underscores South Korea’s commitment to curbing potential risks associated with digital asset investments. By scrutinizing NFTs with characteristics such as large-scale issuance and payment utility, authorities seek to ensure a safer investment environment for crypto enthusiasts.

As South Korea grapples with concerns about future pension fund returns amid declining population trends, regulatory measures like the Korean Virtual Asset User Protection Act gain significance. The law reflects the government’s proactive stance in addressing investor apprehensions and fostering trust in the crypto sector.

Amidst these regulatory shifts, crypto projects in [South Korea](https://worldmagzine.com/business/south-koreas-samsung-electronics-workers-planned-for-a-strike/) face the dual challenge of compliance and innovation. Adapting to evolving regulations while sustaining growth and creativity in NFT-related ventures is paramount for stakeholders navigating the intricacies of South Korea’s dynamic regulatory landscape.

In conclusion, South Korea’s move to regulate NFTs signals a proactive approach to balancing innovation with investor protection in the crypto sector. As the regulatory framework evolves, stakeholders must remain adaptable, ensuring compliance while fostering continued growth and innovation in this rapidly evolving digital landscape.",https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jhonjournalist/comments/1dcmsm6/crypto_nft_issuers_in_south_korea_are_subject_to/

This coin is not just riding the meme trend but also cleverly tying into the political frenzy of the 2024 US presidential election.

**What is VoteDoge?** VoteDoge is a fun and quirky memecoin that combines the light-heartedness of memes with the seriousness of politics. Imagine the iconic Doge, the Shiba Inu, running for president. It’s a hilarious yet engaging way to get involved in crypto and the political scene.

**Why VoteDoge Stands Out:**

1. **Unique Concept**: It’s not just another meme token. VoteDoge turns political engagement into a fun and stress-free activity.
2. **Strong Community and Marketing**: The VoteDoge team isn’t slacking off. They’ve launched billboards in big cities like Vegas and Miami and even dropped catchy campaign songs on Spotify. This creative marketing has given the coin a solid start.
3. **Ambitious Goals**: In just a short time, VoteDoge has reached a $1.4 million market cap and has big dreams of hitting $250 million, then $500 million, and eventually $1 billion. The community is buzzing with excitement to hit these milestones.
4. **Tokenomics**: There are 250 million VoteDoge tokens, representing the number of eligible US voters. Most of these tokens are in the liquidity pool, with a small portion for marketing and the campaign team. Remember, it’s all for fun – don't expect serious investment returns.

**Campaign and Future Plans:** VoteDoge isn’t stopping at just being a meme. They have phases planned out, including getting listed on major exchanges and launching social good initiatives like the DogeCare Initiative and Pawsome Education Act once they reach certain market cap milestones.

If you’re looking for a fun and engaging way to dive into the crypto world while enjoying the chaos of election season, VoteDoge might just be the coin for you. Join the movement, have some laughs, and who knows, maybe we’ll see Doge in the White House (at least symbolically)!

**Campaign and Future Plans:** VoteDoge isn’t stopping at just being a meme. They have phases planned out, including getting listed on major exchanges and launching social good initiatives like the DogeCare Initiative and Pawsome Education Act once they reach certain market cap milestones.

If you’re looking for a fun and engaging way to dive into the crypto world while enjoying the chaos of election season, VoteDoge might just be the coin for you. Join the movement, have some laughs, and who knows, maybe we’ll see Doge in the White House (at least symbolically)!

Single_Offshore_Dad,Newbie introduction ,0,2024-06-10 13:49:53+00:00,"Hey all, glad to be invited here. 

 I was blindly swing trading crypto coins in 2017/18 and ended up losing a large portion of my profits from the bulll run in the down turn. I didn’t know anything about TA, so I took a break and just held onto my remaining btc until 7 months ago when a friend from Trinidad was trading forex and got my interest sparked. Now I’m really deeply involved with learning as much as I can as fast as I can. Ultimate goal is to quit my job and trade full time. 

The market I trade is one that I know: crypto. High leverage, on futures scalp trades. In and out. I’m attempting to build up a large enough portfolio from futures trading to be able to swing trade and slow it down a bit. But until then I’m fast and hard. 

I’m really getting in the zone on my TA skills and LOVE messing around with indicators. I don’t blindly follow them but just love it when they work out. Or price bounces from a certain line or level or formation or divergence. It’s just super cool how it all works.   

My goal is to learn from others in here and try and speak on topics that I know a little about. Maybe I can share some insight even with my short exposure to actively trading and TA.

So far I've added:

    var tls_cert: X509Certificate
    var tls_key: CryptoKey
    var server_tls_options
    func _onready():
        tls_cert = load(""/home/tobyjones/Godot 4 Dev/certificates/cert.crt"")

        server_tls_options = TLSOptions.server(tls_key, tls_cert)

Changed:

    func _on_Host_pressed():
        multiplayer.multiplayer_peer = null
        peer.create_server(DEF_PORT)

to

    func _on_Host_pressed():
        multiplayer.multiplayer_peer = null
        peer.create_server(DEF_PORT,""*"",server_tls_options)

Changed:

    func _on_Connect_pressed():
    multiplayer.multiplayer_peer = null
    peer.create_client(""ws://"" + _host_edit.text + "":"" + str(DEF_PORT))

to

    func on_Connect_pressed():
    multiplayer.multiplayer_peer = null
    peer.create_client(""wss://"" + _host_edit.text + "":"" + str(DEF_PORT))

Skywalkfarms,22 ran into a lot of money and am lost,34,2024-06-10 13:34:28+00:00,"I have inherited a house with 140k in equity on a 3% interest loan with 109k owed left on it. Monthly payments of $810. House Zillow estimate is $249k but I could probably get $250k-$260k. I have 111k in savings and I make around $3500 a month sole supporter. Wife is stay at home mom with our 2 little ones… do we sell the house and move into a nicer house and use the sell price for the current house as the down payment on a 325k house and let it appreciate more?

SnooComics9354,Someone asked me to serve as their intermediary between PayPal & Crypto,15,2024-06-10 13:27:59+00:00,"I hit someone up, let’s call them James. I hit up James because they were selling a cheap PDF guide on a specific side hustle (costed like 15$ USD), and then James offered me the chance to serve as an intermediary between PayPal payments from his clients & James’ crypto wallet

So for example, James has an instagram account that he plans to sell, and someone buys it off of him for 500$. The client wants to pay via PayPal, but James only accepts cryptocurrency. What James suggested is that I receive the 500$ payment on paypal, I take a 120$ cut, and then I send the remaining 380$ to my bank, and then to my personal crypto wallet. Once it’s in my personal crypto wallet, I send the 380$ to James and we both make a profit.

My question would be why James is insisting on only accepting cryptocurrency. He only accepted cryptocurrency when I bought the PDF guide from him, and I didn’t mind because I already use crypto. But I don’t see why he’d need me as an intermediary when he could use PayPal himself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1dcli65/someone_asked_me_to_serve_as_their_intermediary/
